For the purpose of project development, the “cuon-matrix” library was used in place of “gl-matrix” for reasons of user experience and convenience.  The original version of that library is available along with the e-book “WebGL Programming Guide” by Matsuda & Lea. The version used for this project is a student-made extension of the original.
